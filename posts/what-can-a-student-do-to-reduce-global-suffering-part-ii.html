If you haven’t read the first post in this short series, then stop what you are doing and <a href="/posts/what-can-a-student-do-part-i">read this first</a>.

<i>Time</i>: our most valuable asset. When you have it, you don’t realise it, and when you realise it, it’s too late. As a young person, you have a brilliant opportunity: time is on your side. Changes made now can have a large impact because there will be many future years for that change to have an effect. Moreover, young people tend to have fewer responsibilities and a greater affinity for risk-taking, so high-risk high-reward (altruistic reward, that is) paths can be tested without serious repercussions. Students and young people are in a disproportionately good position to start thinking about doing the most good they can do.

Here are 5 more tips for making an evidence-based large positive impact on those most in need:
</p>

<h3>1.	Work hard at your studies</h3>
<p>
While it may not at first seem like this is an effective altruistic thing to do, improving your expected lifetime earnings, life satisfaction, and knowledge will allow you to donate significantly more (and more effectively) in the future.
</p>

<h3>2.	Make contacts</h3>
<p>
Network. It used to bug me that people can get a job over someone more suitable and skilled due knowing someone in the company/organisation/group. I have come to realise that networking is a skill in itself. Networking will improve chances of successful employment (and therefore potential future donations) and also give you an idea as to what career you would like to follow/to see if you would be a good fit for success in that field. If you don’t get along with the people in your potential career, then that career is probably not a good fit for you, therefore you probably wouldn’t succeed in it.
</p>

<h3>3.	Try out different career options</h3>
<p>
As a young person, you likely have less to lose. E.g. internships, summer placements, research projects, casual work, using your free time for writing, coding, or whatever else you think might be a viable and effective career choice. Evidence suggests that the age-old advice of “follow your passion” to find a job that you love is not the best advice. Those who take a more pragmatic approach have <a href="https://80000hours.org/career-guide/job-satisfaction/#should-you-just-follow-your-passion">higher job satisfaction</a>. Don’t try and find the job you are good at, instead work on becoming good at a role, and you might develop a passion for it, and if you don’t, do something else. Try a few different jobs while you are young.
</p>

<h3>4.	Work hard on yourself.</h3>
<p>
This can be both personal and professional development. Making yourself more employable will increase your expected earnings and therefore ability to donate more to effective charities. Things to consider include learning or improving a skill such as programming, writing, or creating an online/social media presence. Making personal improvements is equally valuable for creating a future you who is able to make a huge positive impact on the world. The main things to consider are maintaining good mental and physical health.
</p>

<h3>5.	Volunteer effectively</h3>
<p>
Treat this suggestion with caution. The effective altruists reading this might be a little surprised that volunteering is in this list, and everyone else might be surprised that it is not number one. Generally volunteering does not have a high impact. This is because volunteering opportunities are often over-subscribed; they give relatively little career capital gain and require large administrative costs to manage, so the net impact is often neutral or negative. There are more than enough of these anecdotes to take caution when thinking about volunteering as a way to do good. That being said, there are effective volunteering opportunities. Just like most charities are not worth donating to, but the existence of some very highly effective charities makes donating to them very worthwhile, most volunteering opportunities are a waste of time if the aim is to actually do good, but the existence of a few very effective volunteering opportunities means that it can be a highly effective thing to do. Effective altruism organisations would be a good place to start. Local EA groups and larger EA organisations and effective charities provide a way to volunteer in a way that provides a significant positive contribution to the least fortunate. Secondly, if you have a particular skill that is sort after in the EA community or by an effective charity or social intervention, (such as programming, charity consulting, or writing) you could voluntarily donate your time on an ad hoc basis to people in the EA community, or those who are doing significant good in the world.

<h3>Two take away messages:</h3>
<p>
<h4>Think long term.</h4> Maximise your total lifetime impact, not just your impact over the next week, month, or year. A lifetime of doing \(X\) amount of good per year is much better than doing \(5X\) for one year and nothing for the rest of your life. Initiate a sustainable and regular donation to a few effective charities. This will have a far larger impact than donating a larger lump sum to an average (and therefore ineffective) charity.
</p>

<p>
<h4>Don’t do something because it seems like it will help people, do something because there is clear evidence that it will help people.</h4> And not only that, do the things that the evidence says helps people most effectively. Humans are bad at thinking rationally and are influenced hugely by cognitive biases. These make us come to the wrong conclusion about things that seem obvious. Instead, follow a pragmatic approach and ask yourself not ‘does this sound like it helps people?’, but ‘is the evidence clear that this helps people?’.

Let’s use our privileged position as top 5%-ers to reduce the ridiculous wealth disparity and help those most in need in the most effective ways.
