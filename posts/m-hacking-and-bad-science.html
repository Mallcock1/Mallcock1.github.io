<blockquote>
The more you know the more you know you don't know. - Aristotle
</blockquote>

<p>
This is one of my favourite quotes. It both excites and scares me about science.
</p>

<p>
The physical world is a mess. This is what drew me to mathematics, the space where you can create axiomatic worlds that behave in exotic, but deducible ways. Then I realised that the real world has some moral importance that mathematical worlds do not. So I became interested in how we can use mathematical tools to advance our understanding of the world we inhabit.

Here's a lemma to Aristotle's quote
<blockquote>
The more you know the more you doubt your knowledge - M. Allcock
</blockquote>

<p>
Of science, the great Richard P. Feynman says that
<blockquote>
The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool.
</blockquote>
We each have a duty
