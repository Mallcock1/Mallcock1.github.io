On 15th May 2017, <b>I pledged to donate 10% of my income to the most effective charities for the rest of my life</b>.

<!-- TEASER_END -->

I am now a member of a growing community of effective altruists who have made a lifetime pledge to support effective charities (cite when they update members list).
<a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/"><i>Giving What We Can</i></a> are an organisation that promotes the idea of effective giving and provides a platform for individuals to 
publically pledge to do this. I have made the following <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge/">pledge</a> through Giving What We Can:

<blockquote>
“I recognise that I can use part of my income to do a significant amount of good. 
Since I can live well enough on a smaller income, I pledge that for the rest of my life or until the day I retire, 
I shall give at least ten percent of what I earn to whichever organisations can most effectively use it to improve the lives of others, 
now and in the years to come. I make this pledge freely, openly, and sincerely.”
</blockquote>

<h3> Why? </h3>
The amount of suffering in the world is astounding. One in nine people live on less than $1.90 (in purchasing power) and therefore cannot afford
enough food to meet basic nutritional requirements. [<a href="#WBG16">1</a>] The suffering endured through the torture and slaughter of 
70 billion sentient land animals per year for food is immense [<a href="#ciwf17">2</a>]. This suffering has the potential to increase massively for future
generations as global catastrophes such as climate change develope further. 

By supporting the most effective charities, we can use a portion of our income to significantly reduce this suffering without any meaningful reduction
in our own wellbeing. More information about the philosophy and rational of effective altruism can be found in a 
<a href="http://www.matthewallcock.co.uk/posts/effective-altruism">previous post</a>.


<h3> Why publicise this? </h3>
<p>To donate publically has more positive impact than donating silently. Here's why.</p>

<p>We are social creatures. Most things we do in life are to fit in with the social norm. 
There is almost no culture of giving in the UK apart from in select religious and social groups. 
Within these groups the idea of effectiveness is almost universally absent.
By making this pledge public, I can increase our culture of giving effectively in a small way and, in doing so, 
influence others to increase their donations or improve the effectiveness of their current donations. 
Both of these consequences can lead to considerably less suffering in the world.
If just one other person decides to learn more about effective altruism and then do what I am doing because of my influence then my 
positive impact on the world is effectively doubled.</p>

<p>Thinking more introspectively, by making this pledge public I am more accountable to maintain this rate of giving and therefore am more 
likely to stick to it, which is clearly a good thing.</p>


<h3> Where will the money go? </h3>
The most effective charities are around 1000 times more effective in comparison to a typical charity. (cite?)
These charities generally focus on a single cause that is large scale (causes significant suffering to many), tractable 
(is easy and cheap to influence), and neglected (there is not much money already being used to combat the issue). 
Organisations such as <a href="www.givewell.org">GiveWell</a> and <a href="https://animalcharityevaluators.org/">Animal Charity Evaluators</a> 
use these ideas to assess charities and determine the ones which reduce the most suffering in the world for each £1 donated.

For the same reason that a successful investor spreads his or hers money accross a range of different investments to minimise the impact of one of them collapsing, 
I plan to donate to several of the most effective causes. These will span the general areas of reducing global poverty, reducing the suffering of 
factory farmed animals, and sharing the ideas of effective altruism to the public. 
I will be setting up a page on my website that logs my donations for those interested.


<h3> Isn't that a lot of money? </h3>
The average amount donated to charity by British people is 0.61% of their income<a href="#*">*</a>.
So yes, it is a lot of money compared to the donations of the average well-off person. 
My current income puts me in the wealthiest 3.7% of the world. 
Even after I donate 10% of my income, I will be in the wealthiest 4.6% of the world. [<a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/how-rich-am-i/">3</a>]
Given that I can use this money to vastly improve the lives of others without a significant reduction in my wellbeing, I think it is something I should do.
It is the natural consequence of aligning my actions with my philosophy and world-view.

<h3> Is this the best you can do? </h3>
<p>This is the commitment I am prepared to make at this time. Donating 10% of my income represents a large amount of money but 
still gives me the confidence that it will be very unlikely that it will cause me financial hardship in the future. 
And afterall, if I do come under significant financial strain, I can reduce my donations for a year and pick it 
back up when the money comes in again.</p> 

<p>That being said, I think that the logic behind effective altruism, the immensity of global suffering, 
and the power we have to reduce that suffering for a relatively small amount of money will compell me to donate more than 10% of my income in my lifetime.
I think it is important to set goals of varying achievability for things you would like to accomplish in all aspects of life, and effective giving is no different.
My "achievable" goal is to commit to this pledge for the rest of my life and keep up-to-date with the latest research and recommendations about the most 
effective charities and causes. I have some stronger effective altruism goals that I would like to meet in my lifetime. At some point in the future 
I might publically pledge to commit to these goals. But as of right now, I am comfortable with this pledge of 10%.</p>


<h3> Can I do this too? </h3>
<p> Absolutely! Please do! However, this is not something to be taken lightly and a great deal of thought should be put into it. 
If you think something like this would interest you or you have any questions about it then please feel free to get in touch
either in the comments below or privately through my email which can be found <a href="www.matthewallcock.co.uk/contact">here</a>. 
I, and the effective altruism community as a whole, value criticism and open discussion on these ideas so if you have anything you would like me to clarify or 
respond to then please let me know.</p>
