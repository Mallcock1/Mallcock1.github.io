On 15th May 2017, I pledged to donate 10% of my income to the most effective charities for the rest of my life.

<!-- TEASER_END -->

<blockquote>
“I recognise that I can use part of my income to do a significant amount of good. 
Since I can live well enough on a smaller income, I pledge that for the rest of my life or until the day I retire, 
I shall give at least ten percent of what I earn to whichever organisations can most effectively use it to improve the lives of others, 
now and in the years to come. I make this pledge freely, openly, and sincerely.”
</blockquote>

<h3> Why? </h3>
Link EA post. Link EA assessment post (yet to be written).

<h3> Why publicise? </h3>
So I am committed. To influence other people to do the same. To normalise giving.

<h3> What will I donate to? </h3>
Effective charities. Global poverty, animals, future of humanity, EA organisations.

<h3> Isn't that a lot of money? </h3>
Yes, it is a lot of money compared to the donations of the average well-off person. 
The average amount donated by British people is xxx% of their income. (Citation).
Even if my income does not increase for my whole life this will be a total sum of a few hundred thousand pounds.
This 

<h3> Is this the best you can do? </h3>
Have 2 big aims: Donate 50% income in total. Donate £1,000,000.

<h3> Can I do this too? </h3>
