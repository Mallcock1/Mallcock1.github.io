On 15th May 2017, <b>I pledged to donate at least 10% of my income to the most effective charities for the rest of my life</b>.
</p>

<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p>
I am now a <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/about-us/members/">member</a> of a growing community of effective altruists who have made a lifetime pledge to support the effective charities. <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/">Giving What We Can</a> are a not-for-profit organisation that promotes the idea of effective giving and provides a platform for individuals to publically pledge to do this. I have made the following <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge/">pledge</a> through Giving What We Can:
</p>

<blockquote>
“I recognise that I can use part of my income to do a significant amount of good. Since I can live well enough on a smaller income, I pledge that for the rest of my life or until the day I retire, I shall give at least ten percent of what I earn to whichever organisations can most effectively use it to improve the lives of others, now and in the years to come. I make this pledge freely, openly, and sincerely.”
</blockquote>

<h3> Why? </h3>
<p>
The amount of suffering in the world is astounding. One in nine people live on less than $1.90 (in purchasing power) and therefore cannot afford enough food to meet basic nutritional requirements.[<a href="#WBG16">1</a>] The suffering endured through the torture and slaughter of 70 billion sentient land animals per year for food is immense.[<a href="#ciwf17">2</a>] This suffering has the potential to increase massively for future generations as global catastrophes such as climate change develope further. 
</p>

<p>
By supporting the most effective charities, I can use a portion of my income to significantly reduce this suffering without any meaningful reduction in my own wellbeing. More information about the philosophy and rationale of effective altruism can be found <a href="http://www.matthewallcock.co.uk/posts/effective-altruism">here</a>.
</p>

<h3> Why publicise this? </h3>
<p>To donate publically has more impact than donating silently. Here's why.</p>

<p>We are social creatures. Most things we do in life are to fit in with the social norm. There is almost no culture of giving in the UK except in select social and religious groups. Even within these groups, the idea of effectiveness is almost universally absent. By making this pledge public, I can, albeit in a small way, increase our culture of giving effectively and in doing so, influence others to increase their donations and/or improve the effectiveness of their current donations. Both of these consequences would lead to considerably less suffering in the world. If just one other person decides to donate considerably more and more effectively because of my influence then my positive impact on the world is effectively doubled.</p>

<p>Thinking more introspectively, by making this pledge public I am more accountable to maintain at least this amount of giving and therefore I am more likely to stick to it, which is clearly a good thing. The pledge is not law-binding, of course, and there will be no-one knocking at my door to check that I am donating, but it will give me the motivation to maintain a consistent level of donation.</p>

<p>
Finally, I am very much a fan of the scientific method, <i>i.e.</i> changing beliefs, actions, theories, and conclusions based on new evidence. I am also a fan of peer reviewing, where people in the wider community assesses the correctness of other people's ideas. By publicising my actions that attempt to make the world a better place, I am opening myself up to new information, evidence, and logic that might convince me to adjust my actions. This is a good thing and will help me help the world. On that note, if you do have any way you think I could improve, in whatever way, please let me know! You can do this <a href="/contact/">here</a>, anonymously if you wish.
</p>

<h3> Where will the money go? </h3>
<p>
The most effective charities are around 1000 times more effective than a typical charity.[<a href="#ten95">1</a>] 
For the same reason that a successful investor spreads his or her money accross a range of different investments to minimise the impact of one of them collapsing, I plan to donate to several of the most effective causes. These will span the cause areas of reducing global poverty, reducing the suffering of factory farmed animals, and sharing the ideas of effective altruism to others. I will be setting up a page on my website that logs my donations for those interested.
</p>

<h3> Isn't that a lot of money? </h3>
<p>
The average amount donated to charity by British people is 0.61% of their income<a href="#*">*</a>. So yes, it is a lot of money compared to the donations of the average well-off person. My current income puts me in the wealthiest 3.7% of the world. Even after I donate 10% of my income, I will be in the wealthiest 4.6% of the world (click <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/how-rich-am-i/">here</a> to find out how wealthy you are on a global scale, it might be a little sobering). Given that I can use this money to vastly improve the lives of others without a significant reduction in my own wellbeing, donating a proportion of my income effectively is a natural consequence of aligning my actions with my philosophy and world-view.
</p>

<h3> Is this the best you can do? </h3>
<p>
This is the commitment I am prepared to make at this time. Donating 10% of my income represents a large amount of money over my lifetime but I am confident I can maintain this commitment for life. Afterall, if I do come under significant financial strain, I can reduce my donations for a year and pick it back up when the money comes in again and repay the missed donations.
</p> 

<p>
That being said, I think that the logic behind effective altruism, the immensity of global suffering, and the power we have to reduce that suffering for a relatively small amount of money will compell me to donate more than 10% of my income in my lifetime. Setting goals of varying achievability for things you would like to accomplish in all aspects of life, and effective giving is no different. My "achievable" goal is to commit to this pledge for the rest of my life and keep up-to-date with the latest research and recommendations about the most effective charities and causes. I have some stronger effective altruism goals that I would like to meet in my lifetime. At some point in the future I might publically pledge to commit to these goals. But as of right now, I am comfortable with this pledge of 10%.
</p>

<h3> Can I do this too? </h3>
<p>
Absolutely! Please do! However, this is not something to be taken lightly and a great deal of thought should be put into it. If you think something like this would interest you or you have any questions about it then please feel free to get in touch either in the comments below or privately through my <a href="/contact/">contact page</a>.
