Magnetic fields, quantum tunnelling, gravitational waves? Full of jargon, science is understandably alien to many people. How can scientists make it easier to non-scientists to understand their work? By using only the most common 1000 words in the English language, of course!

Here is the title and abstract of my latest solar physics paper, in simple words. Enjoy!

    <h4 class="card-title">'Sunny wave guessing' with funny waves in funny shapes</h4>
    <p class="lead">'Sunny wave guessing' is the way that we use waves to guess numbers that help us understand more about the Sun - numbers that we don't know! One of these numbers is how strong the strange force on the Sun is. Drawing shapes on paper that look like shapes on the Sun can help us do this. Sometimes these shapes are different on each side, let's call these 'funny shapes', and the waves on these funny shapes are called 'funny waves'. We give two new ways for 'sunny wave guessing' that use these funny waves to see how funny the shapes on the Sun really are. We think that these can be used to guess how strong the strange force that sometimes causes some parts of the Sun to blow-up.</p>

OK, so maybe that didn't make it any easier to understand! Anyway, I'm quite excited about this paper because it bridges the gap between theory and observations, between the maths and the Sun. We have basically used mathematical techniques to come up with a way to use observations of asymmetric waves (AKA funny waves) in the solar atmosphere to estimate the strength of the magnetic field (AKA strange force). There are currently no reliable and accurate methods for measuring the magnetic field in many parts of the Sun. Given that waves are observed in many structures on the Sun, this work provides a key method for doing just that.
