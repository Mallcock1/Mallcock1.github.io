Following on from my <a href="/posts/not-all-charity-is-equal">last post</a> about what criteria we can use to assess the effectiveness of charities, 
in this post I will look at the worst, typical, and best charities based on their effectiveness. 
The difference between the most effective charities and typical charities is around a factor of 1000.[<a href="#ten95">1</a>] 
That is, <b>donating £1000 to a typical charity is equivalent to donating £1 to the most effective ones</b>.
I certainly want the impact of my donations to be the largest it can be, especially now given what I know about the most effective charities.
To understand what types of charities are the most and least effective, here is the good, the bad, and the ugly of altruism.
</p>

<h3>The ugly</h3>

<p>
PlayPumps International is a charity that was founded on the seemingly bright idea that we can use the energy generated by children playing on a roundabout 
to draw clean water from deep underground for local communities that have poor access to water. 
With widespread support from the US government and even sponsorship from music star Jay-Z, PlayPumps International raised a huge amount of money to 
install thousands of children's roundabouts that draw up water as they spin across Africa. 
Without considering any research into the efficacy of this initiative, I would certainly be convinced that it would be a good idea.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, it was too good to be true. PlayPumps actually had a negative impact on many of these communities. 
The force required to bring the water to the surface gave the roundabouts too much resistance for it to be enjoyable for children to use.
Embarrassingly, this meant that often the women of thesecommunities were left to spend hours humiliatingly spinning the roundabout around, 
expending more energy per litre than using a standard water pump.
Whatsmore, the cost of these roundabouts was significantly more than the cost of a standard handpump, therefore the charity were spending much more money 
on a product that was significantly worse.[<a href="#mac13">1</a>]
</p>

<p>
This goes to show that we cannot blindly trust our intuition when it comes to helping others. 
Often we can avoid disasters like PlayPumps by simply asking those in need what we can do to help them before assuming we know best.
In any case, evidence must be used to understand the impact of a charity.
</p>

<h3>The bad</h3>
<p>
Approximately 83% of British charity donations are to domestic charities.[<a href="#alm12">2</a>] 
The majority of these donations are to charities that fund medical research, treatment, or prevention of diseases that primarily effect people in the first-world, 
such as cancer and heart disease. This is understandable because a large proportion of the suffering we see in our lives is due to terminal illnesses that affect us or those dearest to us. 
Let's assess these causes with the scale, tractability, and neglectedness criteria introduced above.
These diseases cause a large amount of suffering because they affect many people and are often terminal, 
in fact cancer causes more deaths per year globally than malaria does, yet combatting malaria is considered a far more worthy cause than combatting cancer.
This is because of the other two criteria: tractability and neglectedness.
</p>

<p>
<i>Third-world diseases</i> such as malaria have been fully eradicated in the developed world because they were easier to eradicate than 
<i>first-world diseases</i> like cancer, for example.
Therefore, we already have cheap, easy, and effective methods for eliminating them.
However, they still cause immense suffering in the developing world. 
Over 400,000 people, mostly children under 5, die from malaria every year.[<a href="#uni17">3</a>]
Almost all of these deaths occur in sub-saharan Africa. Third-world diseases are often very tractable, that is, they can be combatted cheaply and easily. 
The problem is that, unlike in the developed world, there is unsufficient money to accomplish this.
First-world diseases receive an enormous amount of funding for research from both government and private donations yet we still stuggle to make 
significant impact in their eradication. Generally, third-world illnesses are tractable causes, first-world illnesses are not.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, the amount of money donated per person afflicted is much higher for first-world diseases compared to third-world diseases. 
Third-world diseases are neglected, first-world diseases are not.
</p>

<p>
A good rule of thumb is this: <b>if you have heard of a charity, it's probably not an effective one</b>. 
If you have heard of it, then most likely so have many other affluent people, many of whom will have donated to it, making it not a neglected cause.
</p>

<h3>The good</h3>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.againstmalaria.com/">Against Malaria Foundation</a> (AMF) is a charity that distributes insecticide-treated bednets 
and instruction about how to use them to the poorest communities in Africa.
These bednets vastly reduce the chance of getting bitten by a mosquito and therefore reduce the chance of contracting malaria. 
The scale of suffering and death caused by malaria is staggering, as we have seen. 
It is estimated that a life is saved by AMF for every US$500-7000 donated, as well as the huge amount of suffering reduced 
for those who would have otherwise caught malaria but not died from it.[<a href="#giv16">4</a>]
AMF focuses on one method, which has been demonstrated to be the most effective, to help a cause that is one of the most worthwhile. 
This makes AMF one of the most effective charities you can support.
</p>

<p>
Many charities do only a small amount of good with their donations, and some even have a negative impact, the important thing to take away is 
that there are some charities that are extremely effective at reducing suffering in the world, such as AMF. 
Based on the motivations for being effective altruists, donating to these charities would be a great place to start if you want to make the world 
a better place in the most effective way possible. Where will you donate to next?
