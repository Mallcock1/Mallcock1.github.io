Sometimes people ask me what I do. I say I am a solar physics researcher. And sometimes the conversation stops there.
</p>

<p>
But sometimes they want to know what that means. Like, do you research solar energy? No, I study the Sun itself, like astronomy but looking at our own star.

Oh. So you use telescopes then? Usually I look sad and say no. I leave the fun stuff to the observers. Instead, I dejectedly say that I use mathematical tools to model the Sun's atmosphere.

<p>
Well now that's all changed. With the help of some great co-authors, I've published a paper where I actually use observations!!!
