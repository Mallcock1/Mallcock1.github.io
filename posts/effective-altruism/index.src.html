Effective altruism is an area of practical moral philosophy that .

<h3> You are wealthier than you think</h3>
<p>
As of 2016, there are xxxxx billion people living less than US$1 (purchasing power) per day (citation). 
That is, the poorest xxx% of the world live in what the xxx classes as xxx poverty.
Furthermore, the wealthiest 8 people now have as much wealth as the poorest 3.5 billion (Citation).
The vast majority of the suffering endured by the very poorest in the world is due to starvation and illnesses for which there exists a cheap fast cure or prevention.
</p>

<p>
So given this context, how much do <b>YOU</b> think, as a percentage of their annual earnings, 
should the wealthiest 1% donate to help curb the suffering of the poorest people in the world?
<!-- TEASER_END -->
<br><br><br>
1%?
<br><br><br>
5%?
<br><br><br>
10%?
<br><br><br>
In which percentile of global wealth do you think your earnings put you? 
The chances are that since you are wealthy enough to afford the means to be reading this right now, then you are one of the 5% wealthiest people on the planet, 
and probably much higher than that.
If you would like to calculate more accurately the percentile that your earnings lie given the purchasing power in your country, 
you can use the online calculator <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/how-rich-am-i/">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>YOU</b> have the power to significantly reduce the suffering of many human beings (and animals) who live every day with a suffering you have likely never encountered.
But do you have the moral responsibility to act on this?
</p>

<h3>How can I be morally responsible for the reduction of suffering in people I have never met?</h3>
Consider the following scenarios. 
<h4>Scenario 1</h4>
<p>
You are walking along the bank of a waist-deep lake and you are the only person for several miles. 
In the lake you see a young orphaned child, who is drowning. Clearly it is very easy to wade into the water to attempt to save the life of th child. 
By most people's standards, to continue walking past without attampting to save the child's life would be morally reprehensible.
</p>

<h4>Scenario 2</h4>
<p>
Next, consider the same scenario, but this time in your pocket you have your smart-phone. 
If you were to wade in to save the child's life it would probably be at the cost of your mobile phone, which could be several hundred pounds depending on which model you own.
Again, by most people's standards, to continue walking past without attampting to save the child's life, <i>i.e.</i> putting such a low price on a child's life, would be morally reprehensible.
</p>

<h4>Scenario 3</h4>
<p>
Now consider a similar scenario where the child is drowning, and you can save the child's life, at the expense of a new mobile phone, 
but you wouldnt be doing this directly. In other words, you can save a child's life indirectly, <i>e.g.</i> they are in a different country.
Of course, whether the child is drowning in front of you or in a different location has no moral significance. 
If a child's life can be saved at the price of a new phone, regardless of where that child lives, 
or whether you can directly or indirectly save their life, it would be morally reprehensible to not do it.

<p>
But <b>this is the position we find ourselves in every single day</b>. Every day xxx children die from avoidable poverty related causes (citation).
On top of this, many millions more experience a huge amount of daily suffering through hunger or curable illness.
Surely there is no morally significant difference between scenario 3 and the position we are in today.
The implication of this is that if we are morally responsible to act to save the life of the child in scenario 3,
then we are morally responsible to act to save the lives (or reduce the suffering) of as many of the children dying of preventable causes today.
</p>

<h3>Aren't I already a good enough person?</h3>
<p>
Perhaps you are someone who doesn't steal things, doesn't hurt people, doesn't get angry when people make mistakes,
and certainly doesn't judge people by the colour of their skin or their sexuality. Great. 
These are certinly all necessary characteristics that a 'good person' would have; but are they sufficient?
Is it sufficient to just not do wrong things?
</p>

<p>
Consider the world 100 years ago, before the telephone, the television, the internet, and commercial flight, a world vastly different from ours 
in almost all aspects including science, technology, the arts, communication, and politics. What did it mean to be a 'good person' in 1917?
It probably meant you were loving to your family and friends you weren't unpleasant to anyone, stanger or not. 
These characteristics sound remarkably similar to the characteristics of a good person today.
How can it be that almost all areas of life have progressed in the last 100 years, 
yet the characteristics that make someone a good person have remained broadly the same, <i>i.e.</i> don't do wrong things and you are a good person?
I propose that the 'good person' characteristics require significant refinement.
</p>

<p>
Donation of one's time, money, or energy to those in more need than themselves is generally considered as an act that is good to do but not morally wrong not to do.
A deed of this type is known as <a href="#hey16">supererogatory</a>. 
A shift of some supererogatory deeds to non-supererogatory status would bring our characterisation of a good person up to the modern age.
In particular, donating one's time or money to those in more need than themselves is perhaps the most strikingly archaic supererogation<a href="/posts/effective-altruism/#*">*</a>.
That is, it is not sufficient anymore to just not do wrong things<a href="/posts/effective-altruism/#**">**</a>, we should be striving to do donating what we have suplus to our requirements should, to a degree, be part of what makes a person good.

<h3>What impact can one person make?</h3>

<h3>Where would my money do the most good?</h3>

<h3>Where can I learn more...</h3>
<h4>About E.A. philosophy?</h4>
<p>
Firstly, I would suggest either listening to <a href="http://philosophizethis.org/peter-singer/">this</a> if you like podcasts or 
<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism">this</a> if you prefer videos. 
The podcast is an episode from the series <a href="http://philosophizethis.org">Philosophize This</a> 
which I would also recommend as a good starting point to learn about other areas of philosophy.
Both of these resources provide a good short introductions to the motivation of effective altruism and how to start thinking about leading a life that is in line with this philosophy
Further to this, I would recommend signing up to the <a href="https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/">Centre for Effective Altruism</a>'s newsletter 
<a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/get-involved/">here</a>.
</p>

<h4>About effective charities?</h4>
<p>
If you would like to learn more about which charities are the most effective, <i>i.e.</i> which charities give you the most bang for your buck, 
or if you are interested in learning about how we can use a scientific approach to quantify the impact a charity has and how it is much more than just
the percentage of overhead costs then <a href="http://www.givewell.org/">Give Well</a> is a good place to start.
</p>

<h4>About my journey with E.A?</h4>
If you would like to know more about how E.A. has affected my life and how I try to align my decisions with this philosophy then sit tight 
and patiently wait for a future blog post that I plan to write about just this.
Alternatively, you can contact me <a href="/contact/">here</a>.

<h3>Footnotes</h3>
<p><small>
<a name="*">*</a> A discussion about the utilitarian consequences of this statement, while very interesting, is largely irrelevant here because if you are in a position
where you have the means to read this blog, you can likely give a large proportion of your income without it affecting your lifestyle significantly.
A discussion about utilitarianism and effective altruism can be found by <a href="#sin72">Singer, 1972</a>.

<a name="**">**</a> That being said, we are far from an age where people don't do wrong things. 
Even in developed countries, we still have a significant number of murders, rapes, and other acts that cause immense suffering to other humans.
Also, the vast majority of people still contribute to the slaughter of the 1 million land animals for meat, dairy, and egg consuption
and the 20 million fish for food and fishoil products <b>every ten minutes</b> (<a href="#ciwf17">CIWF, 2017</a>; <a href="#fis14">FISH COUNT, 2014</a>) 
which must cause an indescribable amount of suffering.
