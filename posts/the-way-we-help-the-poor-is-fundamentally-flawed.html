I don’t like people deciding what is best for me. I don’t people telling me what to do. In most cases, I am most qualified to decide what I need. It turns out that most people don’t like it when others decide what they need either.
</p>

<p>
So why do we decide what the poorest in society need when we try to help them? Almost all charities have a specific item or service that they provide to the needy - a <a href="https://donate.worldvision.org/gift-catalog/animals">cow for food</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainable-fashion-blog/2015/feb/13/second-hand-clothes-charity-donations-africa">clothes for their backs</a>, or <a href="https://www.samaritans-purse.org.uk/what-we-do/operation-christmas-child/">toys for their children</a><a href="#*">*</a>. Yet another example of the rich deciding what the poor need - the <a href="https://blog.givewell.org/2012/04/12/how-not-to-be-a-white-in-shining-armor/"><i>white in shining armour</i></a> effect<a href="#**">**</a>.
</p>

<p>
Maybe Malawian children need deworming treatments and education over toys, maybe Kenyan farming communities need improved roofing or fistula treatment instead of cattle or a mural on the side of a school. <b>Those in the most need are the most capable at deciding what they most need</b>.

Instead of deciding for them, let's empower the least fortunate by giving them the choice to do what they know will help them most. One very effective</a> charity that is doing just that is <a href="https://www.givedirectly.org/">GiveDirectly</a>, who send direct cash transfers to people living in extreme poverty. Each family has different requirements to bring them out of extreme poverty so let’s give them the dignity to make this choice without risking the corruption of government initiatives.
</p>

<p>
GiveDirectly have some ingenious methods of deciding who to send the money to to minimise divisions within communities and maximise effectiveness. They also put huge emphisis on evaluation to make sure the money donated it being used as effectively as possible. It turns out that almost all of the cash donated goes into improving homes, building businesses, or maintaining a healthy food source for those who have the least. GiveDirectly are <a href="https://www.givewell.org/charities/give-directly">recommended by GiveWell</a> as one of the seven most effective charities for fighting global poverty. That is, if you donate your money GiveDirectly, it is likely to go further than nearly any other charity.
</p>

<p>
Global wealth disparity is sickening. I bet you have wondered how it is that footballers can get paid millions while we have to get by on much less per year? Well, let's reverse the question, have you ever wondered why is it that billions of people don’t even earn enough to meet basic nutritional requirements while you live in relative luxury?
</p>

<p>
Don’t wait for governments to redistribute wealth - take action. By donating to GiveDirectly, you are redistributing wealth from the <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/how-rich-am-i/">top 1-5% of global wealth</a> to the extreme poor.

<a name="*">*</a> Sure, these things probably marginally improve the lives of those who receive them. But the reality is that we have limited resources to help those in need, so if there is a more effective option, which the evidence says there certainly is, then we should support that instead.
</p>

<p>
<a name="**">**</a> At the very least, it is unwise to think that the lay donator knows what is best. To presume this is at best ineffective, and at worst, <a href="/posts/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-of-altruism">detrimental to the poorest societies</a>. Which causes we support must be based on evidence-based, up-to-date knowledge of the most effective interventions, based on what the least fortunate actually need - so leave it to the <a href="www.givewell.org">experts</a>.
