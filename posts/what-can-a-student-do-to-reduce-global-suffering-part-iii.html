It's 
</p>

<h3>7.	Work hard on yourself</h3>
<p>
This can be both personal and professional development. Making yourself more employable will increase your expected earnings and therefore ability to donate more to effective charities or increase you ability to work successfully in a role with large direct impact. Things to consider include learning or improving a skill such as programming, writing, or creating an online/social media presence.
</p>

<p>
Making personal improvements is equally valuable for creating a future you who is able to make a huge positive impact on the world. Perhaps the most important things to consider are maintaining good mental and physical health - being unhappy or unhealthy will have a large detrememntal effect to your ability to succeed in almost any field.
</p>

<p>
<b>Remember that your happiness and suffering matters too!</b> It is of equal importance to those you are trying to help. Don't flog yourself so that you can maximise your impact at the expense of your own happiness.

<h3>8.	Reduce the harm you cause</h3>
<p>
The net impact you have on the world is the positive impact of your good actions minus the negative impact of your everything else. It is easy to be blissfully (and too often wilfully) unaware of the damage we cause by our choices. Three of the biggest culprits are diet, transport, and waste.
</p>

<p>
Consider reducing the amount of suffering you cause to hundreds of sentient animals by reducing your meat, fish, dairy, and egg consumption and progress towards a vegetarian or vegan diet. Train instead of plane, cycle instead of drive. Recycle as much as possible and choose products with little to no non-recyclable packaging. A good rule of thumb is that if youâ€™re throwing away more than you are recycling, you should think about changing up your purchasing habits.
</p>

<p>
Bear in mind that these lifestyle choices have vastly different magnitudes of harm. For example, when it comes to reducing harm caused through contribution to climate change, switching your TV off rather than on standby when not in use is hardly worth bothering with, but reducing your meat, dairy, and egg consumption would cut your contribution to catastrophic climate change drastically (not to mention <a href="http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2006/1000448/index.html">rainforest deforestation, species extinction, water use, and livestock antibiotic overuse</a>).
</p>

<p>
Many of these lifestyle changes, in particular reducing animal product consumption, will incur no extra financial cost, and could even save you money - in which case it's a win-win situation. However, if making a positive lifestyle change is costing you significantly more, then consider the comparative marginal impact that not making the lifestyle change, but instead donating the money you save to the most effective charities. This stratergy can have a much larger impact, and is very much worth considering - see William MacAskill's <a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/doing-good-better/"><i>Doing Good Better</i></a> for more information on this kind of difficult, counter-intuitive, but worthwhile comparison.
</p>

<h3>9.	Volunteer effectively</h3>
<p>
Treat this suggestion with caution! The effective altruists reading this might be a little surprised that volunteering is in this list, and everyone else might be surprised that it is not number one.
</p>

<p>
Generally <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/volunteering">volunteering does not have a high impact</a>. This is because volunteering opportunities are often over-subscribed, they give relatively little career capital gain, and require large administrative costs to manage, so the net impact is often neutral or negative. There are more than enough of these anecdotes to take caution when thinking about volunteering as a way to do good.
</p>

<p>
That being said, there do exist at least some effective volunteering opportunities. Just like the fact that most charities are not worth donating to, but the existence of some very highly effective charities makes donating to those charities very worthwhile, most volunteering opportunities are a waste of time if the aim is to actually do good, but the existence of a few very effective volunteering opportunities means that it can be a highly effective thing to do.
</p>

<p>
Effective altruism organisations would be a good place to start. Local EA groups, larger EA organisations, and effective charities provide a way to volunteer in a way that provides a significant positive contribution to the least fortunate. Secondly, and very importantly, volunteering can only be effective if you have a particular skill that is in shortage in the community or charity or social intervention that you think are worth volunteering for, <i>e.g.</i> programming, charity effectiveness consulting, or writing. You could voluntarily donate your time on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis to people in the EA community, or those who are doing significant good in the world, so that they can have a greater impact.
