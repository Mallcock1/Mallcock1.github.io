Interested in science and pubs? Come and enjoy an evening (or 3) of public science talks, demonstrations, and experiments in a pub in Sheffield next month!
</p>

<ul>
<li> <b>What?</b> I will be giving an outreach talk about my research in solar physics in a pub in Sheffield as part of 
<a href="https://pintofscience.com/">Pint of Science</a>. </li>
<li> <b>Where?</b> My talk is at The Holt Cafe, 156 Arundel St, Sheffield S1 4RE. Other events are spread out at pubs throughout Sheffield. </li>
<li> <b>When?</b> My talk is on 17th May, 7:30-9:45pm. Other events take place on the evenings of the 15th, 16th, and 17th May. </li>
</ul>

<p>
<a href="https://pintofscience.com/">Pint of Science</a> is an international festival that brings together local scientists to talk to the public about their latest research in an informal setting.
This year, I will be giving a talk as part of the <i>Death of Stars: A Dark Matter</i> session alongside fascinating talks given by Dr. Susan Cartwright and Dr. Callum Macdonald as well as some interactive science demonstrations.
</p>

<p>
In my talk, I will be using the latest videos from solar telescopes to highlight some of the most amazing weather events in the solar system. 
Severe space weather is listed by the UK's National Risk Register of Civil Emergencies as one of the most pressing risks to modern civilisation, alongside more publicised issues such as climate change and terrorism.
I will discuss why the Sun poses such a risk, how often it is likely to affect us, and what we can do to prepare ourselves.
Severe space weather might be the most dangerous thing you have probably never heard about! 
More information about my talk and the other events in Pint of Science can be found <a href="https://pintofscience.co.uk/event/death-of-stars-a-dark-matter">here</a>.

<p>
I have been warned that in previous years the session that I am presenting at is the most popular event and tickets could sell out fast. Book yourself a ticket now to avoid missing out. 
You can book tickets to the <i>Death of Stars: A Dark Matter</i> session <a href="https://pintofscience.co.uk/event/death-of-stars-a-dark-matter">here</a>. 
I hope you can come along to enjoy an evening of open discussion about some of the most interesting parts of scientific research in Sheffield.
