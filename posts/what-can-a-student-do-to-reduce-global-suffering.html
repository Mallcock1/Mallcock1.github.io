<p>
Maxed out overdraft, extortionate rental prices, and slashed maintenence grants make financial life as a student rough at best. Many students work part time jobs to make ends meet. So using money for charitable causes is low priority for many students. But can a student have a significant impact on reducing suffering in the world? I think you can, and here is how.
</p>

<h3> Think long-term </h3>
<p> Many situations in life can be solved by considering them as an optimization problem. Doing good is no different. We should aim to optimise the amount of 'good' we do in our lives. What 'good' means is a tricky question. Let $G$ be one unit of 'good' done. We don't just want to have one year of $10G$ if that means that we can only manage $1G$ for the next 10 years. 
</p>

<p>
One $G$ does not necessarily correspond to one unit of money donated to an effective charity. That is because money donated earlier can have a larger impact that money donated later. 
</p>

<p>
For example, consider a £1,000 donation to <a href="https://www.givedirectly.org/">GiveDirectly</a>, a perhaps surprisingly highly effective charity that makes direct transfers of the money donated to the extreme poor[<a href="#*">*</a>]. This intervention works on the idea that individual families in extreme poverty know what they need most more than the affluent people trying to help. The money received through GiveDirectly is commonly spent on weatherproof roofing to provide their family with basic shelter and initial costs for starting a local business to bring themselves out of poverty. If a £1,000 donation is made now, then that donation will significantly improve the lives of a family in extreme poverty. This money could be used to start a small family business. Then the money the family earns through this will improve the lives of the children, their children, and so on.
</p>

<p>
However, if you were to donate £1,000 to GiveDirectly in 30 years, then the poor family has had 30 years of additional suffering before they had been lifted out of poverty. Therefore, a £1,000 donated now is better than £1,000 donated later[<a href="#**">**</a>].
</p>

<p>
Something more like amount of suffering reduced seems like a better measure of the 'good' done, since one 'unit' of suffering will presumably feel just as bad in 30 years as it does now, and no worse.
</p>

<p>
Whatever sensible definition of $G$ we take, the outcome is the same: it is an optimisation problem.
</p>

<p>
let \(G(t)\) be the instantanious 'good' that an action brings at time \(t\). Let \(t = 0\) be the time now and \(t = t_d\) be the point in time of your death. Define the 'total good', \(G_T\), by 
\[
G_T = \int_0^{t_d}{G(t) \, \textrm{d}t}.
\]
This is basically adding up all the good done by you in your life. It can be approximated as follows. Let \(G_i\) be the good that comes about do to your actions in the \(i\)th year of your life from now, and let \(N\) be the number of years you will live from now. Then \(G_T\) can be approximated by 
\[
G_T \approx \sum_0^{N}{G_i}.
\]
This is saying that total good you do in your life is the sum of the good you accomplish in each year of your life from now until you die.
</p>

<p>
The effective altruism optimisation problem is to maximise \(G_T\), that is, to do the most good possible from now until you die. How do you maximise \(G_T\)? This can be done in a number of ways:
<ul>
<li> Increase \(N\). Increase the number of years you have to do good. Live healthily, eat better, move more, improve mental health, etc.</li>
<li> Inresease the average of the \(G_i\)s. Increase the average amount of good that is done each year. There two wrong ways and a right way to do this.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The first wrong way is to focus on increasing \(G_0\). i.e. maximise the current year's good done. This could come at the expense of good in later years. For example, a student could work part time after university every day and donate the money earned to effective charities. This would increase \(G_0\) but had the time been spent on working up from a 2.2 student to a 1st student then the job prospects would improve so expected lifetime earnings would improve.
</p>

<p>
The second wrong way is to try and increase \(G_i\) for all \(i\) between 0 and \(N\) by the same amount. In some years, it might be better to half your \(G_i\) for that year so that you can quadruple your \(G_i\) a few years later. For this reason, it might not be optimal for you to take a giving pledge like the Giving What We Can pledge (LINK) of at least 10% of earnings donated effectively for life. It might be better to not donate at all some years (e.g. if you were to put that money into your own start-up business that was expected to make much more money in the 5-10 year time frame) so that you can donate significantly more than you otherwise would have in the future.
</p>


<p>
The right way to increase the average of the \(G_i\)s is to take a step back and think long-term. What can you do now to maximise the good that you can do later? For example, you

MAYBE PUT THE MATHSY BIT IN A FIRST POST E.G. TITLE: GOOD OPTIMISATION - WHY LONG-TERM THINKING WINS


<h3> Money </h3>
Grants which you can donate a surplus. Saving money. Stop spending money on shit like alcohol. Small regular donations now will make you more likely to donate more later.

<h3> Lifestyle </h3>
Lifestyle choices have a big impact on other people. Many people perceive lifestyle choices as personal choices that can be made without judgement. 

<h3> Time </h3>
Volunteering. Recycling. Vote. 

<h3> Skills </h3>
Develope skills for increased future earning potential.

<a name="*">*</a> On average, 91% of money donated to GiveDirectly makes it directly into the hands of the poor. But remember, the percentage of money spent on overhead costs is not a good metric for deciding the effectiveness of a charity. So what does make a charity effective? See my blog post about this <a href="/not-all-charity-is-equal">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
<a name="**">**</a> It is actually a bit more complicated than that. We must take into account of inflation (of both the donated currency and the currency given to the poor) and the fact that in 30 years we could increase the £1,000 into a much larger donation through savvy investment. But, in general, the suffering reduced by earlier donation trumps the interest you could make on investment of the money instead. CITATION NEEDED
