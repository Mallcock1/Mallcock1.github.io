I have properly changed my mind twice in my lifetime. I don't just mean this morning I planned to have soup for dinner, now I want have stir fry instead. I mean <i>properly</i> changed my mind.
</p>

<p>
The first led me to change what I wear, what I eat, and how I perceive animals. The second led me to change how much I donate, where I donate to, and what career I will follow.

It has become clear that the vast amounts of meat, dairy, and eggs that are consumed is a large contributor to climate change, animal suffering, the obesity epidemic, antibiotic overuse, deforestation, species extinction, ocean acidification, and inefficiencies in the food system leading to world hunger. Learning about the destruction caused by the animal agriculture has influenced my purchasing decisions significantly over the last few years. I would like other people to take similar steps. What I really want to find is a book that I can recommend to people which gives a summary of the main ideas, including ethical, environmental, health, and efficiency issues causes by animal product consumption. That's why my interest was piqued towards The Reducetarian Solution by Brian Kateman.

One candidate is Peter Singer's Animal Liberation. This is the book that changed my worldview more than just about any other. It convinced me that speciesism  - the commonly held belief that different animals, including humans, deserve different moral value purely based on species - is wrong and is one of the motives behind the huge amount of suffering humans inflict on non-human animals through their actions. The first chapter of this book is one I would recommend to anyone. If you are interested in the philosophical underpinnings of veganism then that is a good place to learn from. However, published in 1975, the rest of the book shows its age. It's descriptions of industrial practices from the mid-1900s and mainly focussing on US agriculture makes it easily dismissed by those resistant to changing their destructive habits.

Peter Singer also restricts his focus to just one aspect of the animal story - animal suffering - at the expense of other destructive aspects such as its contribution to climate change and human disease. Finally, it takes an abilitionist approach to the problem of animal liberation. Whilst I agree that abolition of animal exploitation for culinary entertainment, non-culinary entertainment, and researchFOOTNOTE!!! is the appropriate end goal, it has been shown many times that taking a more pragmatic approach - such as asking people to eat meat only for 3 days a week, rather than asking them to abstain from all meat, dairy, and eggs - is more effective.

Contradictory- meat is subsidised and externalised costs. But then you can save money by eating less meat? Yes, both are true! But this just gives readers a basis for doubt.

Chpt 10 7:00. Organ donation stats: surely 71 percentage points not percent.

Chpt 23: meat eating and christianity. Irrelevant to unreligious and not very hard hitting even for religious. V bitty book.

Chpt 25: effective reducetarianism. For reducing suffering, stop eating chicken, then eggs, then pork (didn't include fishor environmental effects). “Just as science consists of the honest and impartial attempt to find the truth, and a commitment to believe the truth, whatever that may be, effective altruism is the honest and partial attempt to work out what's best for the world, and a commitment to doing what's best, whatever that turns out to be.”

Chpt 27: speciesism, surprising and counter to what our instinct and upbringing tells us, but logically consistent

Chpt 32: intuitive eating. “Maybe you need more animal protein in winter, that's ok”. No it's not, and its not even true.

Chpt 33: only 10% of cells in our bodies are human, rest are microbes 

Chpt 51 salad bars open up a whole new world of experiences for kids. Nah, their just healthy, shit tasting food.

Chpt 54 36% of worlds crops are used as farm animal food, yet animal product account for 12% of calories. Food conversion ratio is 2/1 for chicken, 9/1 for pigs and 25/1 for cows.

Chpt 62 if a tap was on filling up a bucket and it was overflowing and getting your shoes wet, you would turn the tap off, not redesign the bucket or your shoes.

Chpt 63 gips and manuhs - barbaric alien civilisation, actually pigs and humans. Of course we wouldn't eat aliens, especially if they were as intelligent as the animals on earth, so why do we eat earth's animals?

Just a list of short essays written by people trying to sell their own book
