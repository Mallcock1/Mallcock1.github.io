<p>
As a student or young person, it is easy to get caught up in your local bubble and forget the most important issues. And even then, it’s easy to feel powerless to do anything about them because we are poor, busy, and underqualified.
</p>

<p>
During my first few years at university, I felt like this too. But taking a pragmatic approach to doing good has showed me just how much of an impact you can have as a student.

<i>Effectiveness</i>: the forgotten criterion in the not-for-profit sector. The most effective ways to reduce suffering in the world are many orders of magnitude more effective than others. This isn't because not-for-profits are ill-intentioned, it's just that they very often don't have counterfactual impact assessments based on evidence. It's no longer sufficient just to think you're making a difference - you must know you are making a difference, and if there is something you can do to have a greater impact, you should do that thing.
</p>

<p>
Here is a list of evidence-based actions that a student can take to most effectively help make the world a better place.
</p>

<h3> 1. Vote</h3>
<p>
In particular, vote in general elections and referenda. This might not at first seem like a particularly effective thing to do given that it is very unlikely that your vote will actually sway the result. However, the amount of impact that you would have if your vote is the one to sway it is huge!
</p>

<p>
If you think there is a large difference between the top candidates then this can outweigh the small probability of your vote swaying the decision. In the case of important votes such as general elections it has been shown that <a href="https://80000hours.org/2016/11/why-the-hour-you-spend-voting-is-the-most-socially-impactful-of-all/">your vote can have somewhere between £1,000 and £10,000 worth of expected impact</a>. Therefore, you should invest as much time into deciding which party to vote for as you would when deciding how to spend £1,000 - £10,000 on anything else such as a car, a phone, or a computer. It is worth your time to learn about the candidates, read local and national manifestos, and vote wisely.
</p>

<p>
Most importantly, don’t just vote for a government that will improve <i>your</i> life, but vote for a government that will improve the lives of those most in need.
</p>

<h3> 2.	Learn about charity effectiveness </h3>
<p>
Find a charity or charities that you are confident will have a huge positive impact. Cost-effectiveness is key. We put in time to decide the best car we can get for our money so we should put in time deciding which charity will give us the most <i>bang for our buck</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the largest impact. The effectiveness of a charity 
</p>

<h3>3.	Donate effectively </h3>
<p>
Even though it might feel like you don’t have much money to donate, it is likely that you are in the top 5 or 10% of wealthiest people globally, with around 10 times the spending money of the global average (see where you fit into the world's wealth distribution <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/how-rich-am-i/">here</a>).
</p>

<p>
However, don’t just donate and expect that you are making an impact. Doing this would very likely lead to donating to a cause or charity that does relatively little in tangible impact – and it could actually be causing harm to the cause you are trying to support! Instead, donate to effective charities. Donating to <a href="www.givewell.org">GiveWell</a>'s recommended charities is a great place to start. They assess charities based on the amount of positive impact they have, not just unimportant things like overhead costs. Check out my <a href="/posts/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-of-altruism">previous post</a> about what actually makes a charity effective and a cause worthwhile. GiveWell use these ideas when they assess charities.
</p>

<h3>4.	Discuss your donations and ethical decisions with others</h3>
<p>
Make giving normal. Make ethical considerations about purchases and decisions normal. Foster a culture of altruism.
</p>

<p>
We are socially influenced creatures. However much we feel like we have ownership over our decisions, ultimately the status quo has a huge impact on what we do. If we don’t see other people giving money to those in need, we won’t either. If we don’t see other people considering the ethical and moral repercussions of their actions, we won’t either. Unfortunately, altruistic actions such as charity donations are seldom discussed. We can help change the status quo by discussing our (effective) altruistic actions. I have written more about this <a href="/posts/giving-what-i-can">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Bear in mind however that too much of this could be seen as <a href="https://vimeo.com/236430422">virtue signalling</a>; that is, doing altruistic deeds for the social credit, even when that is not your motivation. It’s a fine line.
</p>

<h3>5.	Reduce the harm you cause</h3>
<p>
The net positive impact you have on the world is the positive impact of your good actions minus the negative impact of your actions. It is easy to be blissfully (and sometimes wilfully) unaware of the damage we cause by our choices. Three of the biggest culprits are diet, transport, and waste.
</p>

<p>
Consider reducing the amount of suffering you cause to hundreds of sentient animals by reducing your meat, fish, dairy, and egg consumption and progress towards a vegetarian or vegan diet. Train instead of plane, cycle instead of drive. Recycle as much as possible and choose products with little to no non-recyclable packaging. A good rule of thumb is that if you’re throwing away more than you are recycling, you should think about changing up your purchasing habits.
</p>

<p>
Bear in mind that these lifestyle choices have vastly different magnitudes of harm. For example, when it comes to reducing harm caused through contribution to climate change switching your TV off rather than on standby when not in use is hardly worth bothering with, but <a href="http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2006/1000448/index.html">reducing your meat, dairy, and egg consumption would cut your contribution to climate change (not to mention rainforest deforestation, species extinction, water use, and livestock antibiotic overuse) drastically</a>.
</p>

<p>
Many of these lifestyle changes, in particular reducing animal product consumption, will incur no extra financial cost, and could cost you significantly less - in which case it's a win-win situation. However, if making a positive lifestyle change is costing you significantly more, then consider the comparative marginal impact that not making the lifestyle change, but instead donating the money you save to the most effective charities. This stratergy can have a much larger impact, and is very much worth considering - see William MacAskill's <a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/doing-good-better/"><i>Doing Good Better</i></a> for more information on this kind of difficult, but worthwhile comparison.
