I have completely changed my mind twice in my life.
</p>

<p>
The first led me to change what I wear, what I eat, and how I perceive non-human animals. The second led me to change how much I donate, where I donate to, and what career I will follow. It is the former that motivates this post.
</p>

<p>
It has become clear that animal agriculture is a large contributor to climate change, animal suffering, the obesity epidemic, antibiotic overuse, deforestation, species extinction, ocean acidification, and inefficiencies in the food system contributing to world hunger (citation?). Cutting down on animal product consumption is a great way to reduce your negative impact in these areas by encouraging the industry to move towards plant-based products. Learning about the destruction caused by the animal agriculture has influenced my purchasing decisions significantly over the last few years. I would like to give others the information to see if they would like to take similar steps.
</p>

<p>
What I really want to find is a book that I can recommend to people which gives a summary of the main ideas, including ethical, environmental, health, and efficiency issues causes by animal product consumption. That's why my interest was piqued towards <a href="https://reducetarian.org/book/"><i>The Reducetarian Solution</i></a> - a collection of short essays about reducing consumption of animal products, compiled by Brian Kateman.
</p>

<p>
One candidate is Peter Singer's Animal Liberation. This is the book that changed my world-view more than just about any other. It convinced me that <i>speciesism</i>  - the commonly held belief that different animals, including humans, deserve different moral value purely based on species - is wrong and is one of the motives behind the huge amount of suffering humans inflict on non-human animals through their actions. The first chapter of this book is one I would recommend to anyone. If you are interested in the philosophical underpinnings of veganism then that is a good place to begin. However, published in 1975, the rest of the book shows its age. It's descriptions of industrial practices from the mid-1900s are outdated and mainly focussing on US agriculture makes it easily dismissed by those resistant to changing their habits.
</p>

<p>
Peter Singer also restricts his focus to just one aspect of the animal story - animal suffering - and neglects discussion of other destructive aspects. Finally, it takes an abolitionist approach to the problem of animal liberation. Whilst I agree that abolition of animal exploitation for culinary and non-culinary entertainment is the appropriate end goal, it has been shown many times that taking a more pragmatic approach is more effective.

<p>
<i>The Reducetarian Solution</i> is basically trying to give you information to motivate you to reduce your meat, dairy, and egg consumption. The 70+ short essays make for bite-sized snippets, too short to really go into much depth, but enough to get a feel for the arguments presented. It really doesn't make sense to review the book as a whole. But if I were to, I would say something like this: While I enjoyed the general attempt to use a reductionist approach rather than an abolitionist approach, and to cover many different reasons you might want to reduce your animal product consumption, I found it bitty and sometimes boring at best, and contradictory and hyperbolic at worst.
</p>

<p>
But that doesn't really do some of the essays justice, does it? While some of the essays deserve skipping due to their emotional and unscientific pleas for change, some of the essays are genuinely some of the most well written, concise, and powerful writings about the reducetarian movement I have come across. Here were some of my favourite essays:
</p>

<h4>The inner lives of farmed animals / Jacy Reese and Peter Singer</h4>

<h4>From MRES to McRibs: military influence on American meat eating / Anastacia Marx de Salcedo</h4>

<h4>Chpt 25: effective reducetarianism.</h4>
For reducing suffering, stop eating chicken, then eggs, then pork (didn't include fishor environmental effects). “Just as science consists of the honest and impartial attempt to find the truth, and a commitment to believe the truth, whatever that may be, effective altruism is the honest and impartial attempt to work out what's best for the world, and a commitment to doing what's best, whatever that turns out to be.”

<h4>An anthropological survey of carnivory and morality / Avi Tuschman</h4>

<p>
speciesism: surprising and counter to what our instinct and upbringing tells us, but logically consistent
</p>

<h4> Antibiotic resistance at the meat counter / Lance B. Price </h4>

<h4>Chapter 63: Through alien eyes / Nigel Henbest and Heather Couper</h4>
<p>
gips and manuhs - barbaric alien civilisation, actually pigs and humans. Of course we wouldn't eat aliens, especially if they were as intelligent as the animals on earth, so why do we eat earth's animals?
</p>

<h4>Feeding the world and making room for all species / Emma Marris</h4>

<h4>Making the invisible visible: exploitation of livestock workers supports the meat industry / Molly Anderson</h4>





Contradictory- meat is subsidised and externalised costs. But then you can save money by eating less meat? Yes, both are true! But this just gives readers a basis for doubt.

Chpt 10 7:00. Organ donation stats: surely 71 percentage points not percent.

Chpt 23: meat eating and christianity. Irrelevant to the non-Christian and not very hard hitting even for religious. V bitty book.

Chpt 25: effective reducetarianism. For reducing suffering, stop eating chicken, then eggs, then pork (didn't include fish or environmental effects). “Just as science consists of the honest and impartial attempt to find the truth, and a commitment to believe the truth, whatever that may be, effective altruism is the honest and partial attempt to work out what's best for the world, and a commitment to doing what's best, whatever that turns out to be.”

Chpt 27: speciesism, surprising and counter to what our instinct and upbringing tells us, but logically consistent

Chpt 32: intuitive eating. “Maybe you need more animal protein in winter, that's ok”. No it's not, and its not even true.

Chpt 33: only 10% of cells in our bodies are human, rest are microbes 

Chpt 51 salad bars open up a whole new world of experiences for kids. Nah, their just healthy, shit tasting food.

Chpt 54 36% of worlds crops are used as farm animal food, yet animal product account for 12% of calories. Food conversion ratio is 2/1 for chicken, 9/1 for pigs and 25/1 for cows.

Chpt 62 if a tap was on filling up a bucket and it was overflowing and getting your shoes wet, you would turn the tap off, not redesign the bucket or your shoes.

Chpt 63 gips and manuhs - barbaric alien civilisation, actually pigs and humans. Of course we wouldn't eat aliens, especially if they were as intelligent as the animals on earth, so why do we eat earth's animals?

Just a list of short essays written by people trying to sell their own book
