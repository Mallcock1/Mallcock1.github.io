I don’t like people deciding what is best for me. I don’t people telling me what … And I often don’t like receiving presents because they are often not something I need so it just becomes another thing to clutter my house. It turns out that most people don’t like it when others decide what they need either.
</p>

<p>
So why do we decide what the least fortunate in society need when we try to help them? Almost all charities have a specific item or service that they provide to the needy, be that a cow for their farm CITE CHARITY, clothes for their backs CITE CHARITY, or toys for their children CITE OPERATION CHRISTMAS CHILD. This is yet another example of the rich deciding what the poor need.
</p>

<p>
Maybe the Malawian children need deworming treatments and education over toys, maybe the Rwandan farming community needs new roofing or fistula treatment instead of cattle or a mural on the side of a school. Maybe those in the most need are the most capable at deciding what they most need.

<p>
Instead of deciding what we give to them, how about we empower the least fortunate by giving them the choice to do what they know to be best for them. Give Directly give direct cash transfers to the least well-off communities around the world. Each family has different requirements to bring them out of extreme poverty so let’s give them the dignity to make this choice without risking the corruption of government initiatives.

<p>
Give Directly have some ingenious methods of deciding who to send the money to to minimise divisions within communities and maximise effectiveness. They also put huge emphisis on evauation to make sure the money donated it being used as effectively as possible. It turns out that almost all of the cash donated goes into improving homes, building businesses, or maintaining a healthy food source for those who have the least. Give Directly are recommended by GiveWell as one of the 8 most effective charities for global poverty. That is, if you donate your money Give Directly, it will go further than practically any other charity you could think of.

Global wealth disparity is sickening. How is it that footballers can get paid millions while we have to get by on tens of thousands per year? Well, have you ever asked the question why is it that billions of people don’t even earn enough to feed themselves properly while you live in relative luxury? Don’t wait for governments to redistribute wealth, take action. Donate to Give Directly to redistribute wealth from you (likely in the top 1-5% of global wealth) to the least wealthy.
