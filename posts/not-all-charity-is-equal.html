<p>
In a <a href="/posts/effective-altruism/">previous post</a>, I have written about the importance of using an evidence-based approach to determine the most 
good we can do. One aspect of this is assessing the effectiveness of charities.
</p>

<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p>
When buying a new phone, most people spend some time researching the best phone for their requirements and the best phone they can get for their budget.
This is clearly a good thing to do.
However, very few people consider how to make the most impact with their donations to charity. 
We are so careful with the money we spend on ourselves, but don't seem to have that same care over the money we use to do good.
Isn't that odd? It is imperative that we start to research how to make the most difference with our donations.
If we were to buy a phone without looking to buy the best one, we risk being stuck with a clunky phone that cost us too much.
However, if we don't research how to make our donations go furthest, people whose lives could have been saved will die.
That is how it is. <b>It is not just a matter of getting more for your money, it is literally a matter of life or death</b>.
In this post, I will discuss how we can determine the most effective charities.
</p>

<h3>Two sides to the coin</h3>
<p>
When determining the most effective charity, we have to look at two things: the worthiness of the cause, and the efficacy of the charity's method. 
By <i>cause</i> I mean the area that needs our help, for example reducing malaria, 
and by <i>charity</i> I mean the particular organisation that is working to help the cause,
for example the Against Malaria Foundation. Any good assessment of charities must include both of these aspects.
</p>

<p>
To understand the importance of these aspects, first imagine a hypothetical charity that aims to increase the amount of doughnuts eaten by British policemen 
by distributing doughnuts to police stations each week. 
Even though this charity's actions are a good way to reach their aim, it will always be a poor choice of charity to support because the cause, 
doughnut shortage in the UK police, is not a worthwhile cause to support. In this case, the cause is bad, the charity's method is good.
Next, consider a hypothetical charity working to combat malaria in Africa by shouting at mosquitoes, commanding them not to bite people. 
In this case, the cause, reducing malaria in Africa, as we will see, is a very worthy cause, but shouting at moquitoes will obviously not reduce the 
likelihood of them biting and infecting people with malaria. In this case, the cause is good, the charity's method is bad.
The most effective charities use extremely effective methods to help the most worthy causes.
</p>

<h3>What makes a cause worth supporting?</h3>
There are three concepts to consider about the worthiness of a cause: scale, tractability, and neglectedness.

<img src="/scale-neglect-tractability.png" alt="Scale, neglect, tractability piechart" style="height:300px;">
</a>
</center>
</figure>

<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-4">
		<h4><center>Scale</center></h4>
		<p>
		The first thing to consider is the scale of the problem. 
		How many people (or animals) are afflicted by this issue?
		For those that it affects, how debilitating is it for them?
		What is the total suffering caused by it?
		Is this suffering likely to increase in the future, through more people being afflicted or the afflictions worsening?
		The bigger the scale of the problem, the more worthwhile the cause.
		</p>
    </div>
	<div class="col-sm-4">
		<h4><center>Tractability</center></h4>
		<p>
		Next, we must consider the tractability of the problem. That is, how easily and cheaply can we make a difference?
		A cause might be huge and inflict significant suffering, but if we cannot do anything about it, or it costs a huge amount to, 
		then it is not a good cause to focus our donations on.
		There are, as we will see, some very large issues in the world for which we can have a significant impact for a very small cost.
		The more tractable a problem is, the more worthwhile the cause.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="col-sm-4">
		<h4><center>Neglectedness<center></h4>
		<p>
		Finally, we must consider what is already being done in that area.
		If there is already a large amount of money being donated to a particular cause, then more donations will have less impact.
		This is the law of diminishing returns. The more neglected a problem is, the more worthwhile the cause.

<h3>What makes a charity effective?</h3>
<p>
For a charity to be effective, they must have a method of influencing a cause that can be shown, through evidence, to work well.
Too many times we see charities that use a method that sounds ingenious but that actually has little impact 
or even a negative impact on the problem it is trying to solve.
Charities and third party assessors can use control studies to estimate the effectiveness of their intervention. 
Preferably these studies are done before an intervention is put into large-scale use, and the charity must be open to adjusting and refining
its methods as more evidence and self-evaluation is made. 
</p>

<p>
Before charities are recommended as being amongst the most effective, they must be transparent with their impact, preferably in a quantifiable way 
(although there are ways to assess charities when a qualitative approach is not possible). 
Generally, the most effective charities focus on one evidence-based method which has significant impact on one cause. 
The more different methods used and causes focussed on, the higher the chance of one or more of them being bad methods or unworthwhile causes.
</p>

<h3>Does this really matter?</h3>
I, like most people, used to think the difference between the effectiveness of different charities was relatively small, so that it would be a 
waste of money to try to assess which ones are the most effective. 
This is a misconception that has been shown to be so wrong that the difference between the most effective charities and even a typical 
charity is a factor of 1000.[<a href="#ten95">1</a>] 
That is, <b>donating £1000 to a typical charity is equivalent to donating £1 to the most effective ones</b>.
Here is the good, the bad, and the ugly of charity effectiveness.

<h4>The ugly</h4>
<p>
PlayPumps International is a charity that was founded on the seemingly bright idea that we can use the energy generated by children playing on a roundabout 
to draw clean water from deep underground for local communities that have poor access to water. 
With widespread support from the US government and even sponsorship from music star Jay-Z, PlayPumps International raised a huge amount of money to 
install thousands of children's roundabouts that draw up water as they spin across Africa. 
Without considering any research into the efficacy of this initiative, I would certainly be convinced that it would be a good idea.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, it was too good to be true. PlayPumps actually had a negative impact on many of these communities. 
The force required to bring the water to the surface gave the roundabouts too much resistance for it to be enjoyable for children to use.
Embarrassingly, this meant that often the women of thesecommunities were left to spend hours humiliatingly spinning the roundabout around, 
expending more energy per litre than using a standard water pump.
Whatsmore, the cost of these roundabouts was significantly more than the cost of a standard handpump, therefore the charity were spending much more money 
on a product that was significantly worse.[<a href="#mac13">2</a>]
</p>

<p>
This goes to show that we cannot blindly trust our intuition when it comes to helping others. 
Often we can avoid disasters like PlayPumps by simply asking those in need what we can do to help them before assuming we know best.
In any case, evidence must be used to understand the impact of a charity.
</p>

<h4>The bad</h4>
<p>
Approximately 83% of British charity donations are to domestic charities.[<a href="#alm12">3</a>] 
The majority of these donations are to charities that fund medical research, treatment, or prevention of diseases that primarily effect people in the first-world, 
such as cancer and heart disease. This is understandable because a large proportion of the suffering we see in our lives is due to terminal illnesses that affect us or those dearest to us. 
Let's assess these causes with the scale, tractability, and neglectedness criteria introduced above.
These diseases cause a large amount of suffering because they affect many people and are often terminal, 
in fact cancer causes more deaths per year globally than malaria does, yet combatting malaria is considered a far more worthy cause than combatting cancer.
This is because of the other two criteria: tractability and neglectedness.
</p>

<p>
<i>Third-world diseases</i> such as malaria have been fully eradicated in the developed world because they were easier to eradicate than 
<i>first-world diseases</i> like cancer, for example.
Therefore, we already have cheap, easy, and effective methods for eliminating them.
However, they still cause immense suffering in the developing world. 
Over 400,000 people, mostly children under 5, die from malaria every year.[<a href="#uni17">4</a>]
Almost all of these deaths occur in sub-saharan Africa. Third-world diseases are often very tractable, that is, they can be combatted cheaply and easily. 
The problem is that, unlike in the developed world, there is unsufficient money to accomplish this.
First-world diseases receive an enormous amount of funding for research from both government and private donations yet we still stuggle to make 
significant impact in their eradication. Generally, third-world illnesses are tractable causes, first-world illnesses are not.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, the amount of money donated per person afflicted is much higher for first-world diseases compared to third-world diseases. 
Third-world diseases are neglected, first-world diseases are not.
</p>

<p>
A good rule of thumb is this: <b>if you have heard of a charity, it's probably not an effective one</b>. 
If you have heard of it, then most likely so have many other affluent people, many of whom will have donated to it, making it not a neglected cause.
</p>

<h4>The good</h4>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.againstmalaria.com/">Against Malaria Foundation</a> (AMF) is a charity that distributes insecticide-treated bednets 
and instruction about how to use them to the poorest communities in Africa.
These bednets vastly reduce the chance of getting bitten by a mosquito and therefore reduce the chance of contracting malaria. 
The scale of suffering and death caused by malaria is staggering, as we have seen. 
It is estimated that a life is saved by AMF for every US$500-7000 donated, as well as the huge amount of suffering reduced 
for those who would have otherwise caught malaria but not died from it.[<a href="#giv16">5</a>]
AMF focuses on one method, which has been demonstrated to be the most effective, to help a cause that is one of the most worthwhile. 
This makes AMF one of the most effective charities you can support.
</p>

<p>
Many charities do only a small amount of good with their donations, and some even have a negative impact, the important thing to take away is 
that there are some charities that are extremely effective at reducing suffering in the world, such as AMF. 
Based on the motivations for being effective altruists, donating to these charities would be a great place to start if you want to make the world 
a better place in the most effective way possible.

<h3>Where can I learn more?</h3>
<p>
These ideas are put into practice by several organisations such as <a href="www.givewell.org">GiveWell</a>, 
<a href="www.animalcharityevaluators.com">Animal Charity Evaluators</a>, and the <a href="Put website here">Centre for Effective Altruism</a>.
Each of these is fully transparent with there assessment criteria so you can see where they recommend you donate to and why, as well as what the 
potential flaws are of this methodology. 
If you would like to learn more about effective altruism in general then I would recommend you check out Will Macaskill's book 
<a href="WEBSITE HERE">Doing Good Better</a>. If you would like a copy but cannot afford it, then <a href="/contact">let me know</a> 
and I might be able to sort something out.
