I have spoken before about using an evidence based approach to determine the most good we can do. 
One aspect of this is assessing the effectiveness of charities.
</p>

<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p>
When buying a new phone, most people spend some time researching the best phone for their needs and the best phone they can get for their budget.
However, very few people consider how to make the most impact with their charity donations. 
Why is that? If we don't maximise the impact of our donations, people whose lives could have been saved will die. 
<b>It is not just a matter of getting more for your money, it is literally a matter of life or death</b>.
In this post, I will discuss how we can determine what the most effective charities are.
</p>

<h3>Two sides to the coin</h3>
<p>
When determining the most effective charity, we have to look at two things: the worthiness of the cause, and the efficacy of the charity. 
The cause is the area that needs our help, for example reducing malaria, and the charity is the particular organisation that is working to help the cause,
for example the Against Malaria Foundation. Any good assessment of charities must include both of these aspects.
</p>

<p>
To understand the importance of these, first imagine a hypothetical charity that aims to give doughnuts to policemen all over the UK 
by going round and giving doughnuts to police station headquarters for distribution each day. 
Even though the charity's actions are a good way to reach their aim, it will always be a poor choice of charity to support because the cause, 
doughnut shortage in the UK police, is not a worthwhile cause to try to help. In this case, the cause is bad, the charity is good.
Next, consider a hypothetical charity working to combat malaria in Africa by shouting at mosquitoes, instructing them not to bite people. 
In this case the cause, malaria in Africa, as we will see, is a very worthy cause, but shouting at moquitoes will obviously not reduce the 
likelihood of them biting people and infecting them with malaria. In this case, the cause is good, the charity is bad.
The most effective charities use extremely effective methods to help the most worthy causes.
</p>

<h3>What makes a cause worth supporting?</h3>
<h2>Scale</h2>
Things that cause large suffering to a large number of people or animals.

<h2>Tractability</h2>
How easily and cheaply can we make a difference?

<h2>Neglectedness</h2>

<h3>What makes a charity effective?</h3>

<h3>The good, the bad, and the ugly</h3>
Wrap it up. What are the good causes. Examples of v effective charities. Example of typical charities. 
Example of net-bad charity e.g. play pumps/scared straight.
