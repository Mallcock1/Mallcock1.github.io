I have spoken before about using an evidence based approach to determine the most good we can do. 
One aspect of this is assessing the effectiveness of charities.
</p>

<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p>
When buying a new phone, most people spend some time researching the best phone for their needs and the best phone they can get for their budget.
This is clearly a good thing to do.
However, very few people consider how to make the most impact with their donations to charity. 
Isn't that odd? We are so careful with the money we spend on ourselves, but don't seem to have that same care over money we use for altruistic purposes.
It is imperative that we start to research how to make the most difference with our donations.
If we were to buy a phone without looking to buy the best one, we might be stuck with a clunky phone that cost a bomb.
If we make a donation without making that donation go furthest, people whose lives could have been saved will die.
That is how it is. <b>It is not just a matter of getting more for your money, it is literally a matter of life or death</b>.
In this post, I will discuss how we can determine what the most effective charities are.
</p>

<h3>Two sides to the coin</h3>
<p>
When determining the most effective charity, we have to look at two things: the worthiness of the cause, and the efficacy of the charity. 
The cause is the area that needs our help, for example reducing malaria, and the charity is the particular organisation that is working to help the cause,
for example the Against Malaria Foundation. Any good assessment of charities must include both of these aspects.
</p>

<p>
To understand the importance of these, first imagine a hypothetical charity that aims to give doughnuts to policemen all over the UK 
by going round and giving doughnuts to police station headquarters for distribution each day. 
Even though the charity's actions are a good way to reach their aim, it will always be a poor choice of charity to support because the cause, 
doughnut shortage in the UK police, is not a worthwhile cause to try to help. In this case, the cause is bad, the charity is good.
Next, consider a hypothetical charity working to combat malaria in Africa by shouting at mosquitoes, instructing them not to bite people. 
In this case the cause, malaria in Africa, as we will see, is a very worthy cause, but shouting at moquitoes will obviously not reduce the 
likelihood of them biting people and infecting them with malaria. In this case, the cause is good, the charity is bad.
The most effective charities use extremely effective methods to help the most worthy causes.
</p>

<h3>What makes a cause worth supporting?</h3>

MAKE A FIGURE WITH THE THREE CRITERIA IN A TRIANGLE.
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-4">
		<h4><center>Scale</center></h4>
		<p>
		The first thing to consider is the size of the problem. 
		How many people (or animals) are afflicted by this issue?
		For those that it affects, how debilitating is it for them?
		What is the total suffering caused by it?
		Is this suffering likely to increase in the future, through more people being inflicted or the inflictions worsening?
		The bigger the scale of the problem, the more worthwhile the cause.
		</p>
    </div>
	<div class="col-sm-4">
		<h4><center>Tractability</center></h4>
		<p>
		Next, we must consider the tractability of the problem. That is, how easily and cheaply can we make a difference?
		A cause might be huge and inflict significant suffering, but if we cannot do anything about it, or it costs a huge amount to, 
		then it is not a good cause to focus our donations on.
		There are, as we will see, some very large issues in the world that we can have an impact on at a very small cost.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="col-sm-4">
		<h4><center>Neglectedness<center></h4>
		<p>
		Finally, we must consider what is already being done in that area.
		If there is already a large amount of money being donated to a particular cause, then more donations will have less impact.
		This is the law of diminishing returns. The more neglected a problem is, the more worthwhile the cause.
		</p>
	</div>

<h3>What makes a charity effective?</h3>
<p>
For a charity to be effective, they must have a good method of influencing a cause that is evidence based.
Too many times we see charities that use a method that sounds ingenious but that actually has little impact 
or even a negative impact on the problem it is trying to solve.
Charities and third party assessors can use control studies to estimate the effectiveness of their intervention. 
Preferably these studies are done before an intervention is put into large-scale use, and the charity must be open to adjusting and refining
its method as more evidence and self-evaluation is made. 
Before charities are recommended as being amongst the most effective, they must be transparent with their impact, preferably in a quantifiable way 
(although there are ways to assess charities when a qualitative approach is not possible).
</p>

<h3>Does this really matter?</h3>
I, like most people, used to think the difference between the effectiveness of charities was relatively small, so that it is a waste of money to 
try to assess which ones are the most effective. 
This is a misconception that has been shown to be so wrong that the difference between the most effective charities and even a typical 
charity is a factor of 1000. (CITATION NEEDED)
Here is the good, the bad, and the ugly of charity effectiveness.

<h4>The ugly</h4>
<p>
PlayPumps International (CITATION NEEDED) is a charity that was founded on the seemingly bright idea that we can use the energy generated by children playing on a roundabout 
to draw clean water from deep underground for local communities that have poor access t clean water. 
With widespread support from the US government and even sponsorship from 
music star Jay-Z, PlayPumps International raised a huge amount of money to install thousands of children's roundabouts that draw up water as they spin
across Africa. Without considering research into the efficacy of this initiative, I would certainly be convinced that it would be a good idea.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, it was too good to be true. PlayPumps actually had a negative impact on many of these communities. 
The force required to bring the water to the surface gave the roundabouts too much resistance for it to be enjoyable for children to use.
Embarrassingly, this meant that often the women of communities that often were not asked whether they wanted a PlayPump were left to spent hours 
humiliatingly spinning the roundabout around, expending more energy per litre than using a standard water pump.
Whatsmore, the cost of these roundabouts was significantly more than the cost of a standard handpump, therefore the charity were spending much more money 
on a product that was significantly worse.
</p>

<p>
This goes to show that we cannot blindly trust our intuition when it comes to helping others. 
Often we can avoid disasters like PlayPumps by simply asking those in need what we can do to help them before assuming we know best.
</p>

<h4>The bad</h4>
The majority of British charity donations are to domestic charities (CITATION NEEDED). These tend to be charities that fund research, treatment, or prevention
of diseases that primarily effect people in the first-world, such as cancer and heart disease.
Let's assess these causes with the scale, tractability, and neglectedness criteria introduced above.
These diseases cause a large amount of suffering because they affect many people and are often terminal, in fact cancer causes more deaths than malaria does,
yet combatting malaria is considered a far more worthy cause than combatting cancer.
This is because of the other two criteria.
First-world diseases

<h4>The good</h4>
The Against Malaria Foundation (CITATION NEEDED) is a charity that provides insecticide treated bednets for the poorest communities in Africa.
These bednets vastly reduce the chance of getting bitten by a mosquito and therefore reduce the chance of contracting malaria, 
a something something disease that messes you up (SOME DEETS NEEDED). The scale of suffering and death caused by malaria is staggering (SOME STATISTIC AND CITATION NEEDED).


A good rule of thumb is this: <b>if you have heard of a charity, it's probably not an effective one</b>. 
If you have heard of it, then most likely so have many other affluent people, many of whom will have donated to it, making it not a neglected cause.

<h3>Where can I learn more?</h3>
These ideas are put into practice by several organisations such as <a href="www.givewell.org">GiveWell</a>, 
<a href="www.animalcharityevaluators.com">Animal Charity Evaluators</a>, and the <a href="Put website here">Centre for Effective Altruism</a>.
Each of these is fully transparent with there assessment criteria so you can see where they recommend you donate to and why, as well as what the 
potential flaws are of this methodology. 
If you would like to learn more about effective altruism in general then I would recommend you check out Will Macaskill's book 
<a href="WEBSITE HERE">Doing Good Better</a>. If you would like to read this but cannot finance it, then <a href="/contact">let me know</a> 
and I might be able to sort something out.
