<h3> What is effective altruism? </h3>
Link EA blog post.

<h3> I am an effective altruist </h3>
Pledged 10%, link pledge blog post. Treasurer of GWWC Sheffield (link FB page). 
Won debate on 8th May 2017 at University of Sheffield debating society public debate.
Vegan - was vegan before, but surely learning about the suffering of farmed animals and what we can do to prevent it would have made me vegan after learning EA.
