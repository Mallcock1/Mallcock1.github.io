<h3> What is effective altruism? </h3>
<p>
Effective altruism is a way of combining the head and the heart by using evidence and reason to determine the best way to improve the world, and then 
acting on that. The philosophy of effective altruism can be implemented by assessing charities and causes to determine the most effective ones at 
reducing suffering, finding the most altruistic career paths, and determining the most effective ways to advocate for causes. 
We often find that the answers are not what you might think. 
More of my thoughts about effective altruism can be found on my blog <a href="/catagories/cat_effective-altruism">here</a>.
</p>

<h3> I am an effective altruist </h3>
<p>
Since learning about effective altruism in 2016, I have tried to implement it in my life in the following ways:
<ul>
<li>In 2017, <a href="/posts/my-pledge">I pledged to donate 10% of my income to the most effective charities</a> for the rest of my life. </li>
<li>I am the current treasurer of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GWWCSheffield/?ref=br_rs">Giving What We can: Sheffield</a>, a local chapter of 
the not-for-profit <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/">Giving What We Can</a>, which uses events, discussions, and debates to promote the ideas of 
effective altruism in Sheffield. </li>
<li>I eat a vegan diet, that is, I boycott meat, dairy and eggs. 
This provides a fully nutritious diet without financially supporting the animal agriculture industry which causes the unnecessary suffering and slaughter over a 
trillion animals per year and is one of the leading causes of climate change.</li>
<li>I plan to employ an earning-to-give approach with my career. 
That is, I aim to maximise my lifetime income so that I can donate a significant amount of money to the most effective charities. 
The idea is that if I can donate enough to employ 10 charity workers for their lifetime, then that is more effective than, as one person, 
doing direct charity work.</li>
</ul>


<h3> Donation log </h3>
Below is a table of my donations to effective causes.

<table border="1" width="1100">
  <col width="140">
  <col width="580">
  <col width="200">
  <col width="180">
	<tr>
		<td style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 7px;"> <b> Date</b> </td>
		<td> <b>Charity</b> </td>
		<td> <b>Amount</b> </td>
		<td> <b>Notes</b> </td>
	</tr>

	<tr><td colspan="4" style="padding: 3px;"></td></tr>
</table>

If you would like proof of any of these donations, please <a href="http://www.matthewallcock.co.uk/contact">let me know</a>.

<h3> Why publicise this? </h3>
<p>
I like the scientific method and I like making this world a better place. Effective altruism is what you get when you combine these two things.
</p>

<p>
One major facet of the scientific method is the peer-review process - where members of the wider community can assess and comment on the validity 
of an idea or piece of research. By publicising my intentions and actions with effective altruism, I am allowing myself to be peer-reviewed, 
so that I can have discussions with people so that I can try and improve my effective altruistic actions.
I do not pretend to know the best way to improve the world, so if you do have any suggestions of how I can improve my approach, then please 
<a href="/contact">let me know</a>.
</p>

<p>
Another reason for publicising this is that it might encourage other people to increase their charity donations or to make them more effective.
This would be a great thing so I hope it happens! 
It also makes me accountable for my actions, so that I am more likely to continue trying to improve the world in the future.
