I don’t like people deciding what is best for me. I don’t like people telling me what to do. In most cases, I am most qualified to decide what I need. It turns out that most people don’t like it when others decide what they need either.
</p>

<p>
So why do we decide what the poorest in society need when we try to help them? Almost all charities have a specific item or service that they provide to the needy - a <a href="https://donate.worldvision.org/gift-catalog/animals">cow for their food</a> (consider oxfams buy an animal scheme), <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainable-fashion-blog/2015/feb/13/second-hand-clothes-charity-donations-africa">clothes for their backs</a>, or <a href="https://www.samaritans-purse.org.uk/what-we-do/operation-christmas-child/">toys for their children</a>. Yet another example of the rich deciding what the poor need - the <a href="https://blog.givewell.org/2012/04/12/how-not-to-be-a-white-in-shining-armor/"><i>white in shining armour</i></a> effect<a href="../../posts/the-way-we-help-the-poor-is-fundamentally-flawed/#*">*</a>. Sure, all of these things improve the lives of those who receive them (usually, although marginally). But the reality is that we have limited resources to help those in need, so if there is a more effective option, which the evidence suggests is, then we should support that instead.
</p>

<p>
Maybe Malawian children need deworming treatments and education over toys, maybe Kenyan farming communities need improved roofing or fistula treatment instead of cattle or a mural on the side of a school. <b>Those in the most need are the most capable at deciding what they most need</b>. One of my favourite quotes puts it better than I ever could:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Charity ain’t giving people what you wants to give, It’s giving people what they need to get.</p>
<footer>Terry Pratchett, <i>Hogfather</i>.</footer>
</blockquote>

<p>
Instead of deciding for them, let's empower the least fortunate by giving them the choice to do what they know will help them most. One very effective charity doing just that is <a href="https://www.givedirectly.org/">GiveDirectly</a>, who send direct cash transfers to people living in extreme poverty. Each family has different requirements to bring them out of extreme poverty so let’s give them the dignity to make this choice without risking the corruption and ineffectiveness of government initiatives.
</p>

<p>
GiveDirectly employs some ingenious methods to decide who to send the money to to minimise divisions within communities and make sure the money goes to the most in need. They put huge emphasis on evaluation to make sure the money donated it being used as effectively as possible. The receivers of their unconditional cash transfers use the donated money to improve homes, build local businesses for sustainable income, and buy food and clean water. GiveDirectly are <a href="https://www.givewell.org/charities/give-directly">recommended by GiveWell</a> as one of the most effective charities for fighting global poverty, based on their in-depth research. That is, money donated to GiveDirectly, it is likely to go further to reduce the suffering of the extreme poor and alleviate poverty more than nearly any other charity.
</p>

<p>
Global wealth disparity is sickening. I bet you have wondered how it is that footballers can get paid millions while we have to get by on much less per year? Well, let's reverse this question, have you ever wondered why is it that billions of people don’t even earn enough to meet basic nutritional requirements while you live in relative luxury? Realise that from the perspective of <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/how-rich-am-i/">90+% of the world</a>, <b>you are the footballer</b>. Use your money as you would like someone significantly more wealthy than you to do.
</p>

<p>
Don’t wait for governments to redistribute wealth and reduce extreme poverty - take action. By donating to GiveDirectly, you are redistributing wealth from the top 1-5% of global wealth to the extreme poor.
</p>

<h3>Footnotes</h3>

<a name="*">*</a> At the very least, it is unwise to think that the lay donor knows what is best. To presume this, is at best ineffective, and at worst <a href="../../posts/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-of-altruism">detrimental to the poorest societies</a>. Which causes we support must be based on evidence and up-to-date knowledge of the most effective interventions, based on what the least fortunate actually need - so leave it to the <a href="../../posts/the-way-we-help-the-poor-is-fundamentally-flawed/www.givewell.org">experts</a>.

Humility is hard. Humility with money is especially hard. We like to hold our money close to our chest. So close that our financial decisions are rarely discussed. Allowing other people to choose what happens with our money is even more taboo. Over the last few years, I have been questioning this paradigm.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, showing a bit of humility pays. Consider this: if you were to invest your money in stocks, you broadly have two options:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Invest in individual stocks,</li>
<li>Invest in an investment fund.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The general advice for all but the most expert investors is to choose option 2. The motivation for this is that it’s very unlikely that you will select the optimum choice of stocks unless you are an expert. Rather, you are very likely to lose money investing in this way. Instead of choosing stocks yourself, get an expert to do it for you. Acknowledging that experts can make better decisions than you, then deferring investment decisions to them, will get you a higher return. This is financial humility. And it pays.

Following on from my <a href="../../posts/the-reducetarian-solution-a-review/www.matthewallcock.co.uk/posts/open-mindful">last post</a>, a natural question is this: what have I changed my mind about? My two biggest mind-changes occurred within the last 3 years. The first led me to change what I wear, what I eat, and the value I place on non-human animals. The second led me to change how much money and time I donate, where I donate them to, and what I want to spend my career doing. It is the former that motivates this post.

As a student, it is easy to get caught up in your local bubble and forget the most important issues. And even then, it’s easy to feel powerless to do anything about them because we are poor, busy, and underqualified.
</p>

<p>
During my first few years at university, I felt like this too. But taking a pragmatic approach to doing good has showed me just how much of an impact you can have as a student.

On 15th May 2017, I decided to make a change in my life that will have a small impact on me but a large impact on some people I have never met. I am really excited about this opportunity and want to share it with you.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
The ongoing struggle of the poorest people in the world rarely gets a mention on the news or in national political decisions, even though it outweighs the suffering in many of the more publicised stories. Yet there is no moral difference between the value of a child in Burundi and a stranger you meet in the UK. 
</p>

<p>
If you could save a stranger's life in the street but it meant you had to ruin your new shoes or break your phone, you would still do it, because we put moral value on strangers' lives. So if we would sacrifice a small amount to save someone whose life was in jeopardy before our very eyes, shouldn't we save someone's life 10,000 miles away if we could at a similar cost? Of course we should. The reality is that we have the opportunity to do this everyday! We have a wonderful opportunity to make a huge difference to the lives of hundreds of people who are most in need.

Charities are certainly not all equal. We've seen what makes a charity effective or not - if you missed this, check it out <a href="../../posts/not-all-charity-is-equal/">here</a>. But is there <i>really</i> a big difference between them? Is it worth the money/time/effort required to determine the more effective charities, when we could just give that to any old charity? The answer to both of these is, without doubt, YES!
</p>

<p>
We find that the difference between the most effective charities and typical charities is around a factor of 1000.[<a href="../../posts/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-of-altruism/#ten95">1</a>] That is, <b>donating £1 to the most effective charities is equivalent to donating £1000 to a typical one</b>. Therefore it is of utmost importance that we take into account the effectiveness of the charities we donate to, something that very few people do. I certainly want the impact of my donations to be the largest it can be, especially now I know that the most effective charities can have such a large impact with each donation. To understand what types of charities are the most and least effective, here is the <i>good</i>, the <i>bad</i>, and the <i>ugly</i> of altruism. Or, rather, the ugly, the bad, and the good - everyone loves a happy ending!

The debate concerning the use of animals in scientific research is a conflicting one. On the one hand, animals
in testing suffer acutely and in large numbers. However, it can be argued that large part of our current position in 
science and medicine today can be attributed to these tests.
