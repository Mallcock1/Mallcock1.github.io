<p>As a member of the <a href="http://sp2rc.group.shef.ac.uk/">Solar Physics and Space Plasma Research Centre</a> at the 
<a href="http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/">University of Sheffield</a>, I currently research in <a href="/research/#solarMHD">solar magnetohydrodynamic waves</a> 
but have previously completed research in <a href="/research/#meteorology">meterology</a> and <a href="/research/#photovoltaics">photovoltaics</a>. </p>

<p> Waves are a ubiquitous feature of the magnetically dominated solar atmosphere. 
This is continually demonstrated with ever-improving spacial and temporal resolution observations of ground- and space-based solar telescopes.
To understand the context of these observations, we use analytical models of simplified solar environments that we can use <b>mathematics</b> to understand.
</p>

<p> <b>Magnetohydrodynmics</b> (MHD) is the mathematical study of the motion of electrically conduction fluids and provides the appropriate mathematical framework to study many solar structures because the Sun is made up of plasma, which, due to atom dissociation, is electrically conducting.
The equations that govern the motion of an electrically conducting fluid (under a few assumptions that can be made for the dynamics of the Sun) are the MHD equations:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\textrm{D}\mathbf{v}}{\textrm{D}t} &= -\frac{1}{\rho}\nabla{}p - \frac{1}{\mu}\mathbf{B}\times(\nabla\times\mathbf{B}) + \mathbf{g}, \\
\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial{}t} &= - \nabla\cdot(\rho\mathbf{v}), \\
\frac{\partial\mathbf{B}}{\partial{}t} &= \nabla\times(\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}).
\end{aligned}
\]

Under the framework of MHD, we can understand the types of waves supported by solar magnetic structures.
In my research, I have given a definitive study into the magnetoacoustic eigenmodes of an asymmetric magnetic slab, 
demonstrating how the sausage and kink modes are modified (now quasi-sausage and quasi-kink modes) by asymmetry in the background plasma (see blog post 
<a href="/posts/mhd-waves-in-an-asymmetric-slab">here</a>). 
I further showed that the ratio of the amplitudes of oscillation on each side of a magnetised slab has the potential to be used as a diagnostic tool 
in solar magneto-seismology to give an approximation to the magnetic field strength of solar structures.

<p> To a good approximation, the Earth's atmosphere is not influenced by its magnetic field.
However, the Earth rotates at a faster rate than the Sun and is significantly smaller so the Coriolis force 
(a strange force due to the rotation of a system) is much more significant.
Therefore, the dynamics of the Earth's atmosphere are governed by the Navier Stokes Equations with a Coriolis force term, given by:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\textrm{D}\mathbf{v}}{\textrm{D}t} &= -\frac{1}{\rho}\nabla{}p - 2\mathbf{\Omega}\times\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{g}, \\
\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial{}t} &= - \nabla\cdot(\rho\mathbf{v}).
\end{aligned}
\]
</p>

<p> The effect of the Coriolis force is to give a fluid element a force perpendicular to its velocity that makes the element curve to the right (left) in the northern (southern) hemisphere.
This rotational effect introduces some interesting phenomena such as Rossby waves which are large scale waves that oscillate around the globe which can break, causing violent cyclones.
Rossby wave breaking has been linked to the extreme weather in Australia.
</p>

<p>For weather and climate forecasting, the Navier Stokes Equations are solved numerically using the current weather and climate as initial conditions.
During a visit to Monash University, I worked with the School of Earth and Atmospheric Science to assess and compare the simulation of a heat low in 
central Australia using the Australian Community Climate and Earth-System Simulator (ACCESS).
We showed how crucial the lower boundary conditions are to the accurate simulation of this heat low; in particular, 
how parameters such as the soil moisture content and surface albedo are to the precipitation cycle that is interwoven into the formation of the heat low.
This research allows scientists to improve their global climate models for better climate predictions in the future.

<h3><a name="photovoltaics">Photovoltaics</a></h3>
I am interested in renewable energy alternatives and have previously completed research into optimising the geometry of photovoltaic panels, 
using analytical and numerical methods, to see whether alternative curved geometries would improve the incident radiation gathered by a planar geometry.
