In our latest paper, R. Erdelyi and I give a complete account of the transverse magnetoacoustic waves that can propagate along an asymmetric isolated magnetic slab. 
This work builds upon previous work on symmetric magnetic slabs (Roberts etc.), makes an interesting analogy to a classical mechanical spring-mass system, 
and discusses the potential application to magnetic field diagnostics as a tool in solar magneto-seismology.
